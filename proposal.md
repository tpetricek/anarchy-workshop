## Workshop basics

 - Workshop Title! [Discuss here!](https://github.com/tpetricek/anarchy-workshop/issues/1).
 - Organizers & Primary contact - I'm happy to be primary contact, but would like to have 
   at least one co-organizer, preferably someone who has organized similar event before.
   Anyone?

### Abstract

Most of academic work on programming languages is done in a way that makes it possible to evaluate
the presented work using a small number of methods - an idea can be supported by a formal model
with proofs, prototype implementation with measurable indicators or a controlled user study. As
a result, programming language ideas are often shaped in a way that makes such evaluation possible.
As a result, many interesting ideas about programming struggle to find space in the modern 
programming language research community, because we do not yet know how to evaluate them and we
see them as "unscientific".

The aim of this workshop is to provide a venue where such ideas can be presented and discussed.
In the absence of established evaluation methods, our only resort is to subject work to 
constructive critical review. This workshop takes inspiration from literary criticism - 
submissions that provoke interesting discussion will be published together with an attributed
review that presents an alternative position, develops additional context or summarizes 
discussion at the workshop.

The methodology of constructive critical commentary makes it possible to explore a wider space
of programming ideas than those that are covered by established programming language conferences.
This workshop not only enables exploration of new areas of the programming language ideas space, 
but also provides a venue for discovering other areas of the idea space where further quantitative 
or qualitative evaluation methods can be applied.
 
## Motivation
 
### Objectives

The objective of the workshop is to explicitly provide a venue for discussing programming 
language ideas that are difficult to evaluate using established programming language 
evaluation methods. We intend to encourage submissions such as:

 - **Thought experiments.** Just like Galileo's early efforts "involved thought 
   experiments, analogies and illustrative metaphors rather than detailed experimentation"
   (Chalmers 1999, p106), we believe that thought experiments can inspire fruitful
   programming language ideas. Wadler's widely cited, but never formally published, 
   "expression problem" (Wadler 1998) can be seen as such a programming language thought 
   experiment (as argued by Petricek 2015).

 - **Experimentation.** As noted by Hacking, "we find prejudices in favour of theory, as 
   far back as there is institutionalized science" (Hacking 1983, p150). We intend to 
   encourage submissions that "conduct experiment simply out of curiosity to see what 
   will happen." As further noted by Hacking "The physicist George Darwin used to say 
   that every once in a while one should do a completely crazy experiment, like blowing 
   the trumpet to the tulips every morning for a month. Probably nothing will happen, but 
   if something did happen, that would be a stupendous discovery" (Hacking 1983, p151).

 - **Paradigms.** All scientific work is rooted in a scientific paradigm (Kuhn 1970) or 
   scientific research programme (Lakatos 1975). Those define not only appropriate methods
   for answering scientific questions, but also determine what questions are asked.
   We would like to encourage submissions that explore alternative scientific paradigms
   or research programmes by acknowledging that "logically perfect versions (...) usually
   arrive long after imperfect versions have enriched science" (Feyerabend 2010, p8)
 
 - **Metaphors, myths and analogies.** After all, John von Neumann's report on EDVAC, 
   which introduced modern computer architecture, was inspired by a biological metaphor
   and referred to individual computer components as "organs" (von Neumann, 1945)
   and as noted by Heinz von Foerster "we should not forget that any description of
   formal, mathematical, quantitative or even poetical nature still represents just
   an analogy" (von Foerster, 2013).
 
 - **Other non-serious ideas.** As noted by Priestley, the idea that a steam-engine
   could be used to execute laborious computations was first suggested "in a manner which 
   certainly at the time was not altogether serious" sparking "serious consideration of 
   the possibility of mechanical computation" (Priestley 2011, p22).
    
We believe that constructive criticism can provide a way for making discussions triggered
by the above topics a valuable contribution to programming language research literature. 
A secondary objective of the workshop is to begin systematic exploration of the ideas 
in the programming language area and one of the roles of the critical reviews (published
together with accepted submissions) is to provide additional context and relate the 
discussed ideas with other areas of the programming language design space.

### Intended audience (TBD)

[Insert some generic note about how the workshop should be interesting to anyone?]

### Relevance (TBD)

The workshop would complement the main ‹Programming› conference track by providing
a venue for work that:

 - Can trigger an interesting discussion, but is more difficult to evaluate.
 - Explore programming ideas inspired by unorthodox sources of thoughts including
   metaphors, myths and analogies.

By explicitly encouraging such submissions to a less formal workshop format, we would 
like to contribute to the diversity of thoughts represented at the ‹Programming› conference. 

### Context (TBD)

(Any past events related to your workshop including related conferences, previous 
workshops, previous sessions / panels)

 - Discussions at PPIG ?

### Need (TBD)

> If a subject does not permit exactness, it is not sufficient to be exact 
> about something else. (Realms of Value, Ralph Barton Perry)

> The alternative (...) which I am seeking to establish here, is to restore 
> to us once more the power for the deliberate holding of improved beliefs. 
> We should be able to profess now knowingly and openly those beliefs which 
> could be tacitly taken for granted in the days before modern philosophic 
> criticism reached its present incisiveness. (Personal Knowledge, Michael Polanyi)

(Can we get someone else to say nice thing about this idea?)

## Organization (TBD)

 - Details on the organizers (previous workshop organizing experience, etc.)
 - Workshop program committee (indicated as finalized or expected)
 - Would you be willing to merge your workshop with other workshops on a similar 
   topic if this were a condition for hosting your workshop at ‹Programming›?

## Workshop format

 - Planned deadlines
 - Intended paper format
 - Evaluation process
 - Intended publication of accepted papers (printed proceedings or website)
 - Intended workshop format (including duration, number of presentations, and planned keynotes)
 - How many participants do you expect (please make at least an educated guess)
 - What kind of equipment do you need (e.g., data projector, computer, whiteboard)
